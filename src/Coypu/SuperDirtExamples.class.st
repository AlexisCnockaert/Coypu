"let create a timeline of claps to have a rhythmic reference"
16 downbeats to: #cp.
"lets play the claps very quick"
p playFor: 4  bars.

" there is a syntax to create melodies sending asDirtNotes message to a string containing a list of numbers where 0 is c4, 1 is c#4, 2 is d4, -12 is c3 , 14 is d5 and so on ."

p playFor: 16 bars.

"lets mute the supersaw to listen another trick"
p mute: #supersaw.
"the number of trigs (the notes inside a sequencer that are played) can be different from the number of notes - and this yields very interesting stuff"
